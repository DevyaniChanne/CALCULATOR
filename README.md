## EXAMPLE 
Gross Annual Income: â‚¹900,000</BR>
Extra Income: â‚¹60,000</BR>
Age: 34</BR>
Total Deductions: â‚¹36,900</BR>

Error Handling:
All inputs seem to be filled with valid numeric values, so no errors detected.
Tax Calculation:

Calculate Taxable Income:
Taxable Income = Gross Annual Income + Extra Income - Total Deductions</BR>
= â‚¹900,000 + â‚¹60,000 - â‚¹36,900</BR>
= â‚¹923,100</BR>

As per the provided formula:
Since the age is < 40 and the taxable income is above 8 Lakhs, the amount above 8 Lakhs is taxed at 30%.
Calculate Tax:
Taxable amount above 8 Lakhs = â‚¹923,100 - â‚¹800,000 = â‚¹123,100</BR>
Tax = 30% of â‚¹123,100 = â‚¹36,930</BR>

Overall Income After Tax Deductions:
Overall Income = Taxable Income - Tax</BR>
= â‚¹923,100 - â‚¹36,930</BR>
= â‚¹886,170</BR>
